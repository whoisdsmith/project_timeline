1. I was fired on [10/4/12](http://airmail.calendar/2012-10-04%2012:00:00%20EDT) according to the paper work mailed to me from Guardian FIberglass. I did not receive the paperwork in the mail until [after 10/8/12](http://airmail.calendar/2012-10-08%2012:00:00%20EDT), which was the date I went back to work. I was notified in person by Floyd George (head of HR) after a failed attempt to use the time clock.

3. In the paper work sent to my home, it stated that I had abandoned my job after 3 no call no shows. I was unaware that the days I was absent, counted as "no call no shows" until I went back to work on [Monday 10/8/12](http://airmail.calendar/2012-10-08%2012:00:00%20EDT), because I tried to call Guardian, and had no answer so I left a message explaining that my father had a heart attack and I wanted to claim FMLA considering his condition. 

4. [9/30/12](http://airmail.calendar/2012-09-30%2012:00:00%20EDT) I found out that my father had a heart attack, and was in intensive care at Borgess in Kalamazoo. After receiving the news, I was so upset that I went strait to the hospital to see him, thinking that I would be covered by FMLA for missing work considering he was in a near death situation. 

5. I did not receive any warnings before I showed up to work on [10/8/12](http://airmail.calendar/2012-10-08%2012:00:00%20EDT) when Floyd George notified me I was terminated. I showed up to work thinking that they had received my message stating what happened to my father, and that it was covered under FMLA. I did not get any calls telling me not to show up for work, and I did not receive the termination letter in the mail until a few days after I talked to Floyd George.

6. I was absent the week my father was in ICU at Borgess in Kalamazoo. A week before the incident with my father, I was off for the birth of my son, who was stillborn on [9/5/12](http://airmail.calendar/2012-09-05%2012:00:00%20EDT). During that time, my employer gave me unpaid time off to grieve the loss of my child.

7. The date I did not show up to work, I was so upset about my father being in intensive care from a heart attack, that I did not call until later after I had gone to see him and make sure he was going to be ok. I was under the impression I would be covered by FMLA because of the relationship being immediate and the condition he was in. I did call and explain why I was absent after the fact, and explained that I would like to claim FMLA.

8. I was absent when my father was in ICU at Borgess in Kalamazoo, and was also absent when my son was stillborn on [9/5/12](http://airmail.calendar/2012-09-05%2012:00:00%20EDT). Both incidents were immediate family members. My father was in critical care, and my son was stillborn and we had to arrange his funeral.

12. Yes, there in an attendance policy in our handbook which I received upon being hired.

13. I moved to a new address in Albion late-september to be closer to work, which explains why I did not receive the termination letter in the mail until after I talked to Floyd George on [10/8/12](http://airmail.calendar/2012-10-08%2012:00:00%20EDT). I did not have a chance to change my address considering the loss of my son, and the hospitalization of my father.
