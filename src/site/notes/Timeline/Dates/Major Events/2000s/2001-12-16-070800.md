hey, nothin much...im bout to get on line 
but i dont know if ur gonna be on so im writin this 
i hope your mom gets off soon!!! So what have u been doin since we got off the phone?? its like 10 mins after we got of the phone and im bored and i already miss you....you dont know how much i like you its like when were still together 
but i know its about time to leave i just want to stop everything but us and we can be together...i know i might not act like i like you but i do its just that a guy really broke my heart he lead my on and was saying how much he 
liked me and then he really hurt me..but everytime i talk to u i trust u even 
more.... 

and i havent ever liked anyone like this 
i think about u all the time! everytime a song comes(thats good) i think about u 
and i cant get u off my mind i like u so much i cant explain it its just that i dont want to get hurt again... like i did before

everytime i am with you all i think about it how happy u make me feel and the butterflies i get.. you make me feel like no one could ever hurt me again and when i cry im just wishing u were there to hold me and tell me everything is ok it scares me because this is so real and its like a fairy tale we have so much in common

and everytime i try to talk to my mom and tell her no matter what she isnt gonna stop me from liking you she just thinks this is puppy love but i dont think it is when i found out u liked that other girl i was so heart broken i cryed myself to sleep 
and shannon would talk about it all the time and it hurt me so bad.... so i started acting werid around you, but then i realized that i really liked you so i stop acting like that... and we started to like eachother again 

i hope that u dont think im obsessed this is how i feel if u lefted me for someone else i wouldnt care i would just hope that u were happy i am not that kind if u break up with me that i follow u around and try to make u feel bad for what u did... i just would want to be friends with u bc ur a really cool guy and i think we would be really good friends...and if these doesnt work out i would want to talk to u about anything well thats how i feel
