## _Dilapidated warehouse used as practice space by many bands, rumored to be haunted_

After two hours of cleaning its rehearsal space in one of Kalamazoo's most unique and decrepit warehouses, members of the local psychedelic rock band The Red Seas managed to overflow two trash cans.  
They also discarded a moldy, pea-green mini-refrigerator and placed it in the hallway, next to the amassed garbage.

Their practice digs, one of the rooms located in a building at the corner of Porter and Ransom streets just behind Bell's Eccentric Cafe, is part of what has been affectionately dubbed the "666 Building" for well over a decade by local bands, artists and music fans. It's been the site of countless underground shows. Currently, about a dozen bands rent rehearsal space from owners Mike Cole and Ted Thar. It's not much to look at, but you'd be hard-pressed to find a musician who doesn't have a good story about happenings there.

"It's s-----. It's crumbling. But I love it," The Red Seas vocalist/guitarist Chace Wall said last Wednesday from inside the room the band rents. " ... This building is rock 'n' roll."

"It's the rock 'n' roll capital of Kalamazoo," drummer John Jacobs said.

### **Functional, not fancy**

Wall, Jacobs and bandmates Michelle Brenes and Paul Mutsaers had just finished moving from one of the smaller rooms on the second floor of the 666 Building, Room 8, to a larger one down another hall. The previous tenants did not clean it out before leaving, meaning the foursome needed to do the dirty work themselves. With temperatures well into the 90s and little-to-no ventilation, The Red Seas had finally plugged in and were ready to practice. Disco lights reflected off the maroon walls and smoke from Wall's cigarette circled around the 12-by-18-foot room. A bottle of Febreeze sat on top of the broken thermostat, the needle stuck on almost 90 degrees.

"We're living like kings," said Mutsaers, the bassist, as he looked around the new room.  
That's quite a statement considering the building's appearance. A cornerstone on the outside of the warehouse, which got its nickname from its former address, reads "Clarage Foundry and Manufacturing 1913."

The white paint on the brick exterior is flaking off, the walls have been written on, many of the windows are cracked or broken and it seems like half of the fluorescent lights are missing. It's seemingly an endless maze of broken glass, rusted metal and rotting wood. But, for one reason or another, it's close to the hearts of many local bands.

Delton's Mike Cole, director of psychological services at KPEP, which operates residential and non-residential programs for adult offenders, and his business partner Ted Thar, a geographical information services specialist for Van Buren County, bought the warehouse, technically located at 615 Porter St., more than three years ago, Cole said. They planned to use a larger room to store remodeling supplies for their real estate ventures.

The building had about a dozen office spaces that were unused. Cole's cousin suggested they rent the spaces to local bands and introduced Cole to Boston Mann of the metal band Dirtknap. Mann's band took a room and word spread from there.

"Once he (Mann) came in, in two months the place was pretty full of bands. There was a need there. So I thought, 'Geez, I better take advantage of this,'" Cole said.

Cole, 41, said almost 30 bands have rented rooms from him, helping to pay the mortgage and keep the lights on. Currently, almost every room is occupied, he said. The rooms range from 12-by-12-feet to 18-by-20-feet and rent is between $100 and $220, depending on the room's size. The warehouse's condition and its remote location lets bands wail without ticking off neighbors or busting up someone's basement or garage.

"It's not a building you're going to go in and feel like you're walking into a high-class environment. It's sort of grassroots. I think they (the bands) like that," Cole said. "They don't feel pressure that they might ding up a wall or something like that."

#### **Haunted?**

While The Red Seas love the digs, other bands don't share such flowery memories of the 666 Building.

Members of the now-defunct band [[Timeline/Events/Mulligan/Mulligan|Mulligan]] swear the place is haunted. For about four or five months from late 2005 to early 2006, Mulligan vocalist/guitarist Jake Goheen said he and his bandmates had amps turn themselves on and off, heard voices and saw doors lock on their own. They still think the place is haunted and moved out because of it.

"There was a general feeling of not being wanted. You'd try to schedule times when other bands are practicing, so you're not the only ones in the building," he said during an interview last week from Nashville where he has lived since last August.

The most frightening story Goheen remembers was when he was in the building alone and was dragging a sheet of carpet into the room to hang on the wall as a way to deaden sound. The problem: Something or someone pulled on the other end. He turned around to look and there was nothing there. And it wasn't caught on anything.

"It got tugged on like you'd try to rip something out of someone's hand, like someone was trying to take it away," Goheen said. "I dropped it and ran like a little girl."

Although Goheen recommended not entering the building, he said it is a big part of the music community and the bands that have jammed there.

"Until you've done it, you can't understand it," Goheen said. "It makes a stronger community feeling, having a building you have to share, that no one wants to go in unless you have to. It's an experience."
